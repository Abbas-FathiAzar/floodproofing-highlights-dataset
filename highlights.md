- FathiAzar and De Angeli found that expected annual damage depends on building-specific vulnerability, not only distance to rivers.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli stated that dry floodproofing provides shorter payback periods than wet floodproofing.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli observed that wet floodproofing was economically unviable across all studied buildings.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli highlighted that basements increase flood risk but also reduce payback periods for interventions.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli argued that structural defenses like floodwalls can reduce the cost-effectiveness of private floodproofing.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli argued that risk-based incentives tied to avoided damages are fair and effective.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli emphasized that intangible losses such as psychological and social impacts should be integrated in future work.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli confirmed that micro-scale hazard and exposure modeling improves accuracy compared with generic approaches.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli demonstrated that buildings without basements show longer payback periods for interventions.
- FathiAzar and De Angeli argued that the proxy for estimating floodproofing costs should differ: building perimeter for dry floodproofing and building area for wet floodproofing.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli argued that three criteria should guide the selection of damage functions for micro-scale assessment: transferability, granularity, and flexibility.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli argued that models such as BC_MRA can be used both as standalone tools and as functional nodes within larger decision-making ecosystems.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli stated that the BC_MRA framework can facilitate the design of risk-based and equitable incentive mechanisms for climate change adaptation.  
- FathiAzar and De Angeli argued that among cost-based, performance-based, and risk-based incentives, the risk-based approach is the most effective.
